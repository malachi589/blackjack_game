                <P class="notify-words">The goal of a blackjack is to beat the dealer's hands without going over 21.
                    Face cards are worth 10.Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
                    To 'HIT' is to ask for another card. To 'STAND' is to hold your total and end your turn.
                    To 'DEAL' is to clear all the cards on the table so that a new game begins.
                    If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
                    your wins increases on the table, as well as ur losses and draws
